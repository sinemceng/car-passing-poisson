## Features
- Calculates Poisson probabilities using the average number of cars passing per minute (mu).

- Converts probabilities to percentages and rounds them.

- For each possible car count:

    - Colored bar chart

    - Line plot connecting the points

    - Percentage label above each bar

- Includes title, axis labels, grid lines, and custom fonts.

- Saves the resulting chart as poisson_cars_per_minute.png.

## Libraries Used
- NumPy – Numerical operations and array handling

- Matplotlib – Plotting and visualization

- SciPy – Poisson distribution probability calculation

- Matplotlib.cm – Color mapping

When executed, the program calculates and visualizes the Poisson probability distribution for an average of 4 cars per minute.
